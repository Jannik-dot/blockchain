# blockchain
This is the source code to a program that creates a blockchain and miners trying to mine blocks for the blockchain.
The blocks are encrypted using sha256 and the miners are trying to guess the hashfunction of the next block in the chain.
Once they guess correctly the block is added to the blockchain. Additionally Chat-users are simulated that use the blockchain to communicate with
each other.
